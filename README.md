# Image Gradient Analysis
<b>End Goal</b>: Create an application that enables exploration of image gradients, B.Y.O.G.<br>
<b>Why</b>: Simply to challenge myself and exercise applying concepts created in my head.<br>
WIP 10 May 2020


## Planned Basic User Interaction
1. Browse for an image stored locally
2. Click an area of the photo containing the target gradient
3. Get visual and numerical output, including:
   * Nature of the gradient (linear, circular)
      * If circular, provide pixel coordinates or highlight the circle's origin
      * If linear, provide the angle of the gradient
   * Image overlay tracing the path of the gradient
